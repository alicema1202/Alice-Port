                    In a medical setting, the medical receptionists are the first point of contact for patients in person and over the phone. In general, they are responsible for organizing the medical office's operations. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our two stakeholders, both medical receptionists, ensure the smooth running of the medical office by communicating with clients/patients, managing schedules, making appointments, addressing patient inquiries, and more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a typical workday, medical receptionists rely on multiple digital tools to streamline workflow. However, inefficiencies in these systems often lead to frustration and delays in patient care. By exploring their experiences and challenges, this project aims to identify opportunities to improve workflow efficiency and enhance the overall patient care experience.

He leads interns in the research department, organizing shifts, coordinating tasks, and training interns. He also does work with papers that his department is working on as well as a large project that the clinic is involved in.

                    We met up with our stakeholders in person and conducted an interview for 1-1.5 hours. The interview consisted of open-ended questions as well as a walkthrough of some of their daily work tasks. The goal of the interview was to learn more about how they interact with applications at work, in hopes of gaining insight about challenges/frustrations that they face. Here is a summary of our findings:

                    Flow 2 differs by addressing a different stakeholder issue. Rather than focusing on the repetitive check-in process, flow 2 aims to assist stakeholders by simplifying their workflow. Currently, our stakeholders need to switch between different programs and windows to update patient records, so flow 2 aims to streamline this process and limit the amount of switching between programs.

                    For our user test, we interviewed two stakeholders. One stakeholder is a head intern at a neurosurgery clinic, and the other is an ER intern. We found them through contacting mutual friends.
                    <br>
                    Our interview questions include two tasks, one per flow. After each task, we asked the participants a series of follow-up questions about the prototype, so that we can understand what they liked/disliked about it, as well as identify any areas of frustration and confusion.

                <p class="hidden">
                    During user testing, we discovered that users liked both prototypes. Our users liked the simplicity of flow 1 because of the lack of unnecessary information. While the prototype for flow 1 would reduce the workload for our users, this prototype is meant to be used by patients rather than our stakeholders. They found it confusing on how it would be implemented in real life. For flow 2, our users liked that it simplified the process by using a single interface, but our stakeholders were concerned about the feasibility of combining multiple processes into one. We believe flow 2 should be further developed based on our stakeholders frequent tasks.

                    For our next step, we decided to move forward with flow 2, the medical record updating feature because this feature aligns more closely with our stakeholders daily work tasks and contributes to a more significant area of their work. 
                    <br>
                    For our high-fidelity prototypes, we have to create clearer interactions. Based on our interview with one of our stakeholders, they addressed that flow 2 lacked clear visual indicators. We plan on creating buttons that are more obvious to help address our users' needs and create a smooth workflow.

                    In our alternate screen, we decided to modify the top navigation bar so that the user can keep track of incoming notifications. To reduce the cognitive load on our users, the improved top bar can help with keeping track of email notifications, with the top as the most recent. In our current design, the only way to keep track of recent emails is through individual patient pages, which might be difficult if the user forgets which patient or the ID they were recently looking at. Our alternative screen makes it easier for the user by allowing the user to reference recent notifications and the patient the notification is about.

                    In this alternative screen, we redesigned the way our user moves a file into patient documents. In the original version (left), the patient docs are organized in a list of folders that each have a “move here” button. In the alternative version (right), we decided to minimize the repetitiveness of the button and rearranged the folders into a grid view with a singular “move to [folder name]” button at the bottom. The alternative design highlights which folder has been selected by filling the folder blue and specifying the selected folder in the “move” button's text label. From user testing next week, we hope that we can learn which method of interaction and organization the users prefer (grid vs. list) and whether they prefer multiple or one “move” button.

                    For our final user testing session, we conducted a round of informal user testing, where we asked our two users to go through the initial hi-fi prototype, and asked them to give us overall feedback. Then, we showed them our two alternative screens, and asked them to tell us their thoughts about the different versions. The feedback they gave us revealed small visual design flaws as well as gave us a clear step towards our final design.

                        <strong>Scrollable:</strong> Based on our feedback, users think the prototype should be scrollable because it will give users a better idea of how the actual website functions. We decided to make it scrollable because it will be a better representation of the real website. The main features we made when making the prototype scrollable was to make the header sticky. This will allow users to easily navigate throughout the website.

                        <strong>Inbox: </strong>Both of the feedback we received favored alternative option for viewing the message inbox. For our final design, we will be including an inbox icon on the top right corner because it will be easier to find and see when there is a new message. Users can preview their new messages without switching to a new page. We think this will improve the user's experience because they can view their new messages anywhere on the website since it will be in the header.

                        <strong>List & grid view: </strong>Another improvement we will be making is creating a list & grid view because based on our feedback, our users prefer viewing files in grid view. By providing both options, people can customize their experience to their own preferences. So between our original and alternative 2 screens, we decided to combine both of them and allow the user to toggle between them.
