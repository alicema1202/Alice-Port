                CineMa is a mobile ticketing app that gives movie enthusiasts a convenient and easy way to purchase and scan movie tickets. CineMa aims to ease the process of mobile ticketing overall and offer users a smooth experience.

            <div class="body">
                I conducted two usability studies throughout my design process to identify user pain points. Through my research, it became evident that these pain points included: lack of language options and bundled ticket scans.

                Basic Information
Name: Zhao
Age: 42 years old
Hometown: China
Occupation: Restaurant owner in San Francisco

Profile
Zhao is from China, and she recently moved to the US with her husband and their two children, who all enjoy going to the movies. Since Zhao speaks little English, she doesn’t like speaking with theater workers to purchase tickets. Zhao hopes to find a solution for her problem.

Zhao’s User Journey Summary
Zhao may feel left out when realizing that there are no language options to choose from when she browses movies on theater sites. When Zhao’s family is at the movie theater, she might also get impatient having to scan individual tickets.

                Paper to Digital
            </div>
            
            <div class="body">
                To start the design, I began by sketching paper wireframes to get a basic idea of the app before converting them onto digital platforms.
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                After creating these wireframes, I brought them over to Figma and made low fidelity wireframes, which I then turned into a working lo-fi prototype.

                User Testing
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                After building the low-fidelity prototype, I moved on and conducted my first usability study, from which I gathered new insights:

Lacked language options

Users need to be able to review their ticket order

There should be the option of bundle scanning

Upon iterating on my low-fidelity prototype after the study, I created high-fidelity prototypes for my second usability study, where I gained more findings:

The user flow was missing a seat selection feature

Some gesture and touch options were not working

Movie titles should be includes in the tickets

            <div class="body">
                After conducting both usability studies, I made some changes to my high-fidelity prototype!
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                1. Seat Selection

Adding seat selection is a crucial feature for users to order movie tickets, offering a convenient way to choose seats.
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                2. Language Options

Adding language options is a must to improve accessibility for many users whose preferred language is not English.      </div>

            </div>
            
            <div class="body">
                1. Language Options
The first step that users take in my app is to choose their preferred language. Because this is the first step, users do not have to spend extra time trying to figure out how to change languages within the app’s settings.

2. Contrasting Colors
With contrasting colors, the app is more helpful to those with visual impairments, as the high contrast will ease their ability to read the contents of the app.

3. Labels
I have put labels on the movie posters after the user purchases tickets. This allows the screen reader to detect what movie ticket the user is browsing through.

                What I Learned:

I learned that user opinion often differs from my expectations, which made me realize the important of user feedback and research because the end product would definitely not be user centered without the research.
